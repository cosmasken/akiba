    </p>
    <strong>Safeguarding your Password and Security Codes</strong>

    </p>
    <p>
      6.3.6 After initial registration we will never contact you (or ask anyone to do so on our behalf) with a request to disclose your security codes in full. If you receive any such request from anyone (even if they are using our name or logo and appear to be genuine) then it is likely to be fraudulent and you must not supply your security codes to them in any circumstances. Additionally, you should report any such requests to us immediately.
